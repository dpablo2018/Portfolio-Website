            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I was originally a political science major, but now I'm doing computer science and I love it. I used to be heavily involved in student government and that set my motion for getting into politics. At the start of the pandemic, I lost an internship so I quit politics all together. I would say in those different roles, I gained a lot of leadership experience, leading most activities and being able to collaborate with others.</p>
