# Description
I needed to make a portfoilio with my work and make the nav bar scrollable when clicked. I created the head and body tag with the document. Inside the body tag I needed to make a header tag with a nav bar and make it clickable when the user clicks it, the click will go to the setion. I created another header with an image and two boxes that are clickable with my work. After that I have a footer.

### USage

I made the boxes with my work using classes. Lines 36 and 43 have classes that make them change their background color, changing the text color, border radius to give it rpunded corners.
