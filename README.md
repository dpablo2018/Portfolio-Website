# Description
I needed to make a portfoilio with my work and make the nav bar scrollable when clicked. I created the head and body tag with the document. Inside the body tag I needed to make a header tag with a nav bar and make it clickable when the user clicks it, the click will go to the setion. I created another header with an image and two boxes that are clickable with my work. After that I have a footer.
